# logtoxray

Write to logs, get X-Ray traces. No distributed
tracing instrumenation library required.

ðŸš§ ðŸš§ ðŸš§ THIS PROJECT IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS PROTOTYPE.

## Installation

```
$ go get github.com/rakyll/log-to-xray/cmd/logtoxray
$ my_program | logtoxray
```

## Usage

Users should include trace_id and span_id in every entry.

In order to start a new segment, log an entry
with start_time.

```
{
    "trace_id": "1-581cf771-a006649127e371903a2de979",
    "id": "70de5b6f19ff9a0b",
    "name": "auth.CurrentUser",
    "start_time": "2021-06-28 17:09:12.0 -0700 PDT"
}
```

Append as many as changes with new log entries.
Note that trace_id, span_id, start_time and end_time
are immutable.

```
{
    "trace_id": "1-581cf771-a006649127e371903a2de979",
    "id": "70de5b6f19ff9a0b",
    "annotations": {
        "service": "auth",
        "region": "us-east-1"
    }
}
```

In order to finish a segment, write an entry
with end_time:

```
{
    "trace_id": "1-581cf771-a006649127e371903a2de979",
    "id": "70de5b6f19ff9a0b",
    "end_time": "2021-06-28 17:10:26.086625 -0700 PDT"
}
```
